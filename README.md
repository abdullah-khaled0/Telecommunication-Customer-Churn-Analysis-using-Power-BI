# Telecommunication Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI

I've completed a project focused on Telecommunication Customer Churn using Power BI. The primary objective of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying factors driving customer churn within our telecommunications company.

üìä **Key Insights:**

### ‚úÖ Senior Citizen Demographics
Strikingly, approximately 83.8% of our customer base consists of non-senior citizens (individuals younger than 65 years old), implying that the majority of our customers are younger individuals.

### ‚úÖ Dependency and Churn
Customers with dependents, such as family members relying on the same account, are notably less likely to churn. This finding suggests that our services may have a higher retention rate among customers with dependents, contributing positively to customer loyalty.

### ‚úÖ Contract Length and Churn
A considerable portion of our customers are on a month-to-month contract, with a higher churn rate observed among them. Exploring opportunities to incentivize longer-term contracts could lead to more stable and predictable revenue streams.

### ‚úÖ Internet Service Type and Churn
Customers with Fiber optic connections have a higher churn rate compared to DSL customers. Improving the quality and reliability of Fiber optic services could reduce customer dissatisfaction and churn.

### ‚úÖ Online Security and Churn
Customers without online security subscriptions are more likely to churn, highlighting the importance of promoting and possibly bundling online security services to enhance customer retention.

### ‚úÖ Payment Method and Churn
There is a correlation between payment methods and churn, with customers using electronic checks having a higher churn rate. Encouraging the adoption of more stable payment methods may reduce churn.

### ‚úÖ Paperless Billing and Churn
Customers opting for paperless billing have a slightly higher churn rate compared to those preferring traditional billing methods. Improving the user experience and communication surrounding paperless billing could align it better with customer preferences.
